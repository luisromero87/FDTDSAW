FortranFile
===========

fortranfile.py (`<http://launchpad.net/fortranfile>`_) reads and writes
unformatted Fortran files. These files contain binary data such as strings,
integers and floating-point numbers in a record-oriented format where the
length of the record in bytes is prepended and appended. While the Fortran
standard doesn't specify that unformatted output files must have this
structure, it is very commonly used by different Fortran compilers.

See the docstring at the top of ``fortranfile.py`` for usage information.  `Numpy
<http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ is required.

Quick Start
-----------

::

  >>> import fortranfile
  >>> f = fortranfile.FortranFile('output.dat')
  >>> x = f.readReals()
